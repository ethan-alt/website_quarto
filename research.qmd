My research involves the development of Bayesian methods for the design and analysis of clinical trials. In particular, I have an interest in robust informative prior elicitation using historical data and/or expert opinion. I also have interest in Bayesian subgroup identification using shrinkage priors and Bayesian nonparametrics methods.

Below is a list of my published papers (listed chronologically by acceptance date). For works in progress, check out my CV.
