My research involves the development of Bayesian methods for the design and analysis of clinical trials. In particular, I have an interest in robust informative prior elicitation using historical data and/or expert opinion. I also have interests in subgroup estimation and identification.

Below is a list of my published papers (listed chronologically by publication/acceptance date) as well as submitted works in progress.
